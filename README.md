# HR Analytics: Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using advanced machine learning techniques. 
Leveraging a real-world HR dataset, we explore patterns and design models to address employee retention challenges. Our solution provides actionable insights for HR professionals to make data-driven decisions.

## Business Understanding
### Problem Statement:
Employee turnover poses significant challenges for organizations, including increased costs and reduced productivity. This project identifies key drivers of attrition and provides actionable recommendations for HR teams to enhance employee retention strategies.

### Stakeholders:
- **HR Teams**: Seeking data-driven methods to identify and mitigate employee attrition.
- **Organizations**: Aiming to reduce costs associated with hiring and training replacements.

### Business Goals:
- Identify major factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Provide HR teams with tools and insights for targeted interventions.

## Data Understanding
### Dataset Details:
- **Dataset**: HR capstone dataset.
- **Timeframe**: [Specify if known].
- **Features**: Includes employee demographics, performance metrics, and work environment factors.

### Data Limitations:
- Missing values in some key features.
- Potential biases due to sample demographics or industry-specific data.

#### Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Visualizations such as histograms for salary distribution.
- Scatterplots revealing relationships between job satisfaction and attrition.
- Correlation heatmaps identifying significant predictors of attrition.

## Modeling and Evaluation
### Models Used:
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - A simple yet effective baseline model for binary classification.

2. **Decision Trees**:
   - Interpretable models capturing non-linear relationships.

3. **Random Forests**:
   - An ensemble method to enhance predictive performance.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall prediction correctness.
- **Precision and Recall**: Evaluate model performance in identifying attrition cases.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Assesses the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.

### Results:
- Highlight the best-performing model and significant feature importances:
  - E.g., Job satisfaction and work-life balance were the strongest predictors of attrition.

## Conclusion
### Key Findings:
- **Major Factors Influencing Attrition**:
  - Low job satisfaction.
  - Lack of career growth opportunities.
  - Imbalanced work-life conditions.

### Recommendations for HR Teams:
- Introduce regular employee feedback mechanisms.
- Provide career development opportunities.
- Promote work-life balance initiatives.

### Future Work:
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse industries.
- Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning.
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., economic indicators) for improved predictions.



### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed on your system.
- Verify that all required libraries are included in `requirements.txt`.
